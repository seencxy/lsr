Goject [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/imaramos/goject.png)](https://travis-ci.org/imaramos/goject)
======

Goject is intended to be a easy way to do dependency injection in Go Applications.

This is a fork of [inject](https://github.com/facebookgo/inject) with the purpose of filling the lack of support and extensability, because it seems to be no longer maintained.
